# Is the current tightest lockdown restrictions in the UK justified by the new COVID variants increasing the risk of "Long COVID"?

**Next, you will play the role of the client and the data scientist. Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer.**

The UK remains under a tight form of lockdown as more age groups are vaccinated. There are calls for lockdown to be eased as the 'elderly' age group have almost been completely vaccinated. However, there are a rising number of cases with people having "Long COVID" for several months after their initial infection, which can have serious long-term consequences. With the rising number of COVID variants entering the population (such as the "South-African Variant), Doctors want to know if these COVID variants are increasing the chances that a COVID patient develops "Long COVID", as this will be essential evidence for policymakers to continue the tight lockdown restrictions until roughly the entire population is vaccinated.
Using data on COVID variants in the population and the number of COVID patients developing "Long COVID" over time, is there a significant relationship between COVID variants and "Long COVID" to suggest that COVID variants could trigger more patients to have "Long COVID"?

**Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with.**
**Analytic Approach,**
**Data Requirements,**
**Data Collection,**
**Data Understanding and Preparation,**
**Modeling and Evaluation**

1. As this problem involves identifying the relationship between COVID variants and "Long COVID", a Descriptive Approach will be used. Machine Learning can be used to identify this relationship as future COVID variants enter the population.
2. As for the data requirements, a patient is classified as having "Long COVID" if they report symptoms of fatigue for over 2 months following the 2 week initial COVID infection period (having tested positive for COVID). A COVID Variant must be confirmed to be official by the World Health Organisation and the first case of this COVID Variant in the population is the date of its introduction into the population. Also, include collection of control variables that could be affecting "Long COVID" numbers, such as the periods of low lockdown restrictions, "Long COVID" patients with prior medical conditions of fatigue etc. In order to isolate the effect of COVID variants on "Long COVID".
3. Data will be collected from March (when UK lockdown began). Data will be collected from NHS records as well as private hospital records (whilst most private hospitals do not contain COVID wards, it is likely that people exhibiting "Long COVID" symptoms will have visited private hospitals as NHS will be at full capacity. Also, collect data from NHS and private hospital records for "Long COVID" patients that had previous fatigue symptoms.
4. As for understanding Data, use Histograms to plot the number of people with "Long COVID" (following a positive COVID test two weeks prior) against time to get a rough estimation of how the frequency of Long COVID is distributed over time. As for Data preparation, remove the "Long COVID" patients that had prior fatiguing medical conditions from the dataset.
5. With the Machine Learning descriptive approach outlined in section 1, run a decision tree algorithm using past data. The outcome variable will be YES if a patient with COVID has "Long COVID" following an outbreak of a COVID variant (controlling for variables like past medication conditions). This model will be trained over time as more data is available on cases of Long COVID and new COVID variants emerge. As for the evaluation part, use an ROC curve to assess whether this is an optimal model for analysing the relationship.
