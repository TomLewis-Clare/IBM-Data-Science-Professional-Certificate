# Quiz - From Deployment to Feedback

1. The final stages of the data science methodology are an iterative cycle between Modelling, Evaluation, Deployment, and Feedback.
- [x] True
- [ ] False

2. Select the correct statement about the Feedback stage of the data science methodology.
- [ ] Feedback is not required once launched.
- [ ] Feedback is not helpful and gets in the way.
- [x] Feedback is essential to the long term viability of the model.
- [ ] None of the above statements are correct.

3. Deploying a model into production represents the end of the iterative process that includes Feedback, Model Refinement, and Redeployment.
- [ ] True.
- [x] False

4. Select the correct sentence about the data science methodology explained in the course
- [ ] The data science methodology depends on a specific set of technologies or tools.
- [ ] The data science methodology always starts with data collection.
- [ ] The data science methodology is not an iterative process – one does not go back and forth between methodological steps.
- [x] The data science methodology provides the data scientist with a framework on how to proceed to obtain answers.

5. A data scientist determines that building a recommender system is the solution for a particular business problem at hand. This is represented by the Modeling stage of the data science methodology?
- [ ] True
- [x] False


6. A car company asked a data scientist to determine what type of customers are more likely to purchase their vehicles. However, the data comes from several sources and is in a relatively “raw format”. What kind of processing can the data scientist perform on the data to prepare it for the Modeling stage?
- [ ] A. Feature Engineering.
- [ ] B. Transforming the data into more useful variables.
- [ ] C. Combining the data from the various sources.
- [ ] D. Addressing missing invalid values.
- [ ] Only options A and D are correct.
- [ ] Only option C is correct.
- [ ] None of the options are correct.
- [x] All of the options are correct.

7. Data scientists typically use descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques for exploratory analysis of data and to get acquainted with it.
- [x] True.
- [ ] False.

8. Data scientists may frequently return to a previous stage to make adjustments, as they learn more about the data and the modeling.
- [x] True.
- [ ] False.

9. Data scientists may use either a “top-down” approach or a “bottom-up” approach to data science. These two approaches refer to:
- [ ] "Top-down” approach – models are fit before the data is explored. “Bottom-up” approach – data is explored, and then a model is fit.
- [ ] “Top-down” approach – the data, when sorted, is modeled from the “top” of the data towards the “bottom”. “Bottom-up” approach – the data is modeled from the “bottom” of the data to the “top”.
- [x] “Top-down” approach – first defining a business problem then analyzing the data to find a solution. “Bottom-up” approach – starting with the data, and then coming up with a business problem based on the data.
- [ ] “Top-down” approach – using massively parallel, warehouses with huge data volumes as the data source. “Bottom-up” approach – using a sample of small data before using large data.

10. What are three important reasons that data scientists should maintain continuous communication with business sponsors throughout a project?
- [ ] Actually, data scientists do not need to maintain a continuous communication with business sponsors and stakeholders.
- [x] So that business sponsors can review intermediate findings.
- [x] So that business sponsors can provide domain expertise.
- [x] So that business sponsors can ensure the work remains on track to generate the intended solution.
